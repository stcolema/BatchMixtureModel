\arguments{
\item{X}{The data matrix to perform clustering upon (items to cluster in rows).}

\item{K}{The number of components to model (upper limit on the number of 
clusters found).}

\item{B}{The number of batches to model.}

density of the cluster means.}

density of the cluster covariances.}

density of the batch mean effects.}

batch scale.}

\item{t_df_proposal_window}{The rate for the Gamma proposal density of the 
cluster degrees of freedom.}

\item{R}{The number of iterations to run for.}

\item{thin}{thinning factor for samples recorded.}

\item{concentration}{Vector of concentrations for mixture weights 
(recommended to be symmetric).}

\item{m_scale}{The scale hyperparameter for the batch shift prior 
distribution.}

the user. If ``false`` then initial values are drawn from the prior 
distribution.}

initialised by the user. If ``false`` then initial values are drawn from the
prior distribution.}

initialised by the user. If ``false`` then initial values are drawn from the 
prior distribution.}

initialised by the user. If ``false`` then initial values are drawn from the
prior distribution.}
