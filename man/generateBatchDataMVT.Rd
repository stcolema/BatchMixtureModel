\title{Generate batch data from a multivariate t distribution}
\usage{
generateBatchDataMVT(
  N,
  P,
  group_means,
  std_dev,
  batch_shift,
  batch_var,
  group_weights,
  batch_weights,
  dfs,
  frac_known = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of items (rows) to generate.}

\item{P}{The number of columns in the generated dataset.}

\item{group_means}{A vector of the group means for a column.}

\item{std_dev}{A vector of group standard deviations for a column.}

\item{batch_shift}{A vector of batch means in a column.}

\item{batch_var}{A vector of batch standard deviations within a column.}

\item{group_weights}{A K x B matrix of the expected proportion of N in each group in each batch.}

\item{batch_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each batch.}

\item{dfs}{A K-vector of the group specific degrees of freedom.}

\item{frac_known}{The number of items with known labels.}
}
\value{
A list of 5 objects; the data generated from the groups with and
without batch effects, the label indicating the generating group, the
batch label and the vector indicating training versus test.
}
\description{
Generate data from K multivariate t distributions with 
additional noise from batches. Assumes independence across columns. In each
column the parameters are randomly permuted for both the groups and batches.
