\usage{
generateBatchDataVaryingRepresentation(
  N,
  P,
  class_means,
  std_dev,
  batch_shift,
  batch_var,
  class_weights,
  batch_weights,
  frac_known = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of items (rows) to generate.}

\item{P}{The number of columns in the generated dataset.}

\item{class_means}{A vector of the class means for a column.}

\item{std_dev}{A vector of class standard deviations for a column.}

\item{batch_shift}{A vector of batch means in a column.}

\item{batch_var}{A vector of batch standard deviations within a column.}

\item{class_weights}{A K x B matrix of the expected proportion of N in each class in each batch.}

\item{batch_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each batch.}

\item{frac_known}{The expected fraction of observed labels. Used to generate
a ``fixed`` vector to feed into the ``batchSemiSupervisedMixtureModel`` function.}
}
\value{
A list of 4 objects; the data generated from the clusters with and
without batch effects, the label indicating the generating cluster and the
batch label.
}
\description{
Generate data from clusters across batches. Assumes independence
across columns. In each column the parameters are randomly permuted for both
the clusters and batches.
