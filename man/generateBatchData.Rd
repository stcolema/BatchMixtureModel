\usage{
generateBatchData(
  N,
  P,
  cluster_means,
  std_dev,
  batch_shift,
  batch_var,
  cluster_weights,
  batch_weights,
  frac_known = 0.2

}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of items (rows) to generate.}

\item{P}{The number of columns in the generated dataset.}

\item{cluster_means}{A vector of the cluster means for a column.}

\item{std_dev}{A vector of cluster standard deviations for a column.}

\item{batch_shift}{A vector of batch means in a column.}

\item{batch_var}{A vector of batch standard deviations within a column.}

\item{cluster_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each cluster.}

\item{batch_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each batch..}
}
\value{
A list of 4 objects; the data generated from the clusters with and
without batch effects, the label indicating the generating cluster and the
batch label.
}
\description{
Generate data from clusters across batches. Assumes independence
across columns. In each column the parameters are randomly permuted for both
the clusters and batches.
