\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of items (rows) to generate.}

\item{P}{The number of columns in the generated dataset.}

\item{group_means}{A vector of the group means for a column.}

\item{batch_shift}{A vector of batch means in a column.}

\item{group_weights}{One of either a K x B matrix of the expected proportion 
of each batch in each group or a K-vector of the expected proportion of the
entire dataset in each group.}

\item{batch_weights}{A vector of the expected proportion of N in each batch.}

\item{type}{A string indicating if data should be generated from
multivariate normal ("MVN") or multivariate t ("MVT") densities (defaults to
"MVN").}

\item{group_dfs}{A K-vector of the group specific degrees of freedom.}

\item{frac_known}{The number of items with known labels.}

\item{permute_variables}{Logical indicating if group and batch means and
standard deviations should be permuted in each column or not (defaults to
``TRUE``).}

\item{scale_data}{Logical indicating if data should be mean centred and 
standardised (defaults to ``FALSE``).}

\item{std_dev}{A vector of group standard deviations for a column.}

\item{batch_var}{A vector of batch standard deviations within a column.}
}
\value{
A list of 5 objects; the data generated from the groups with and
without batch effects, the label indicating the generating group, the
batch label and the vector indicating training versus test.
}
\description{
Generate data from K multivaraite normal or multivariate t
distributions with additional noise from batches. Assumes independence across
columns. In each column the parameters are randomly permuted for both the
groups and batches.
