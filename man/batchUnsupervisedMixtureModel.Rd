\arguments{
\item{X}{Data to cluster as a matrix with the items to cluster held in rows.}

\item{R}{The number of iterations in the sampler.}

\item{thin}{The factor by which the samples generated are thinned, e.g. if
``thin=50`` only every 50th sample is kept.}

\item{batch_vec}{Labels identifying which batch each item being clustered is
from.}

\item{type}{Character indicating density type to use. One of 'MVN'
(multivariate normal distribution) or 'MVT' (multivariate t distribution).}

\item{initial_labels}{Labels to begin from (if ``NULL`` defaults to a
stick-breaking prior).}

\item{K_max}{The number of components to include (the upper bound on the
number of clusters).}

\item{alpha}{The concentration parameter for the stick-breaking prior and the
weights in the model.}

\item{mu_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the cluster mean proposal
kernel.}

\item{cov_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the cluster covariance
proposal kernel.}

\item{m_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the batch mean proposal
kernel.}

\item{S_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the batch standard deviation
proposal kernel.}

\item{t_df_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the degrees of freedom
for the multivariate t distribution (not used if type is not 'MVT').}

\item{phi_proposal_window}{The proposal window for the shape parameter for
the multivariate skew normal distribution (not used if type is not 'MSN').}

\item{m_scale}{The scale hyperparameter for the batch shift prior
distribution.}

\item{rho}{The shape of the prior distribution for the batch scale.}

\item{theta}{The scale of the prior distribution for the batch scale.}

\item{initial_cluster_means}{A $P x K$ matrix of initial values for the class 
means. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_cluster_covariance}{A $P x P x K$ array of initial values for the 
class covariance matrices. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_batch_shift}{A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch 
shift effect Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_batch_scale}{A $P x B$ matrix of initial values for the batch
scales Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}

\item{initial_cluster_df}{A $K$ vector of initial values for the class degrees
of freedom. Defaults to draws from the prior distribution.}
