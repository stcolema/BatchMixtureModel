Description: C++ implementation of semi-supervised and unsupervised Bayesian 
  mixture models that jointly infer the group structure and a batch correction. 
  Densities available are the multivariate normal and the multivariate t. This
  package is aimed at analysis of low-dimensional data generated across several
  batches. See Coleman et al. (2022) 
  <https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.14.476352> for details of the model.
