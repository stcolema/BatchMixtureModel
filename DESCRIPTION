Description: This package includes a C++ implementation of both semi- and 
  un-supervised Bayesian mixture models that jointly infer the group and a batch
  correction. Denities available are the multivariate normal and the multivariate 
  t. This package is aimed at analysis of low-dimensional assay data generated
  across several batches such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay data.
